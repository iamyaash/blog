# Monthly Report - `m4`:

1. Started looking into the upstream [forgejo/forgejo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo) issues and found these two issue to be interesting,
    - [feat: indicate commit order in PR view #5178](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5178)
    - [ feat: appearance setting should have an font size setting (accessibility) #5693 ](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5693)

    - I have talked with the folks in Forgejo Matrix channel about [#5693](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5693) issue, as it seems more interesting and is a low-hanging fruit. It could be a great starting point to work on some UI stuffs, since it will eventually be used in [Fedora's Forgejo](https://codeberg.org/fedora/forgejo)

2. The [issue in Pagure related to replacing the CSI information](https://pagure.io/infra-docs-fpo/issue/350) is inactive for a while. There was [discussion thread opened](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/updating-infra-apprentice-page-outdated-csi-related-information-need-changes/143979) for getting some ideas or proposal for what information to replace with the now nonexistant CSI information. We ended up getting some inputs from more people, some of which are beyond the scope. Finally, we decided to work on improving fields more for more descriptive and useful.

3. Started working on the Forgejo Upstream Issue, to revamp the commit list layout. [https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5178](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5178).
    - Created an initial design for the commit table layout, but it still needs feedback and input. I will raise a GitLab ticket with the Fedora Design team and share the demo in the Forgejo Deployment channel to gather suggestions.
    - I'm becoming more comfortable working with the Forgejo codebase, which is a good thing, I'm also learning Tailwind CSS and Go Templates & it's getting more interesting as I keep working on it. (_It's fun learning new things_)

### Minor Tasks:
-  [chore: updated copyright years across all the codebase headers #183](https://github.com/fedora-infra/pagure-exporter/pull/183) - _Merged_ ✅
    - Changing copyright years across all the files in [pagure-exporter](https://github.com/fedora-infra/pagure-exporter).
    - Somehow the test cases failed, even though I only made changes to the comments block inside the source code.
- [minor-fix: added navbar border color in light-theme #17](https://codeberg.org/fedora/forgejo/pulls/17) - _Merged_ ✅ 
    - Added border color to the vertical navbar in light theme, which went unnoticed when making changes previously.
