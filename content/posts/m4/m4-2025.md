# Monthly Report - `m4`:

1. Added border color on vertical navbar in Forgejo light theme, which went unnoticed while making changes previously and got the [PR Merged ✅](https://codeberg.org/fedora/forgejo/pulls/17). (_It's relatively a simple fix tho_)

2. Started looking into the upstream [forgejo/forgejo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo) issues and found these two issue to be interesting,
    - [feat: indicate commit order in PR view #5178](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5178)
    - [ feat: appearance setting should have an font size setting (accessibility) #5693 ](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5693)

I have talked with the folks in Forgejo Matrix channel about [#5693](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/5693) issue, as it seems more interesting and is a low-hanging fruit. It could be a great starting point to work on some UI stuffs, since it will eventually be used in [Fedora's Forgejo](https://codeberg.org/fedora/forgejo)

3. The [issue in Pagure related to replacing the CSI information](https://pagure.io/infra-docs-fpo/issue/350) is inactive for a while. There was [discussion thread opened](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/updating-infra-apprentice-page-outdated-csi-related-information-need-changes/143979) for getting some ideas or proposal for what information to replace with the now nonexistant CSI information. We ended up getting some inputs from more people, some of which are beyond the scope. Finally, we decided to work on improving fields more for more descriptive and useful.

### Minor Tasks:
-  [chore: updated copyright years across all the codebase headers #183](https://github.com/fedora-infra/pagure-exporter/pull/183) - _under review_ ⏳
    - Changing copyright years across all the files in [pagure-exporter](https://github.com/fedora-infra/pagure-exporter).
    - Somehow the test cases failed, even though I only made changes to the comments block inside the source code.
