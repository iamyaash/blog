### 1. Flock to Fedora 2025 in Prague, Czech Republic (5–8 June)

*This was my second time attending an open-source conference and my first time traveling internationally. The city of Prague was amazing; despite being a city, it had a lot of greenery. The climate was wonderful, making it a truly pleasant experience.*

* Volunteered at the Registration Desk on 7th June, but most attendees had already registered on the 6th. Only one person registered in the afternoon on the 7th.
* Had the opportunity to interact with many passionate open-source contributors, there’s always something to learn from their conversations.

* **Talks attended on 5th June:**
  * *Opening Remarks!* (FPL sceptre passed from Matthew Miller to Jef Spaleta)
  * *Making the Most of Forgejo's Upcoming Features You Should Know* - Otto Richer
  * *Fedora's Gaming Renaissance: The Bazzite Effect* - Noel Miller, Antheas Kapnekakis
  * Joined the Mentor-Mentee Lunch Matching session, which was insightful. I learned a few things about job hunting in open-source careers - _Sumantro Mukherjee, Julia Bley, Nikita Tripathi_

* **Talks attended on 6th June:**
  * *Bootable Containers: Moving from Concept to Implementation* - Sean Thraikill
  * *Mentored Project Learnings & Demo* - Sumantro Mukherjee, Aurelien Bompard, Akashdeep Dhar
  * *Open Source Mentorship: Crafting Communities, Creating Leaders* - Nikita Tripathi, Samyak Jain

* **Talks attended on 7th June:**
  * *Dist-Git Implementation in Forgejo* - Tomas Hrčka
  * *Improving Infrastructure Applications* - Aurelien Bompard

* Beyond the talks, I connected with many amazing people during the conference.
* We also had a boat party, which was a lot of fun (*you can see a photo from it in the featured image of this post*). Interestingly, it was also my first time on a boat!

> I’m currently writing a blog post about [Flock to Fedora 2025](). It’s still under review, with a lot of changes pending. By the time you read this report, it may already be published - feel free to check it out if you’re curious about my experience!

### 2. Forgejo Commit Layout Changes

* I've made significant progress compared to last month; the desktop layout is nearly complete.
* The mobile layout still needs some feedback and confirmation before finalizing the design.
* While working on this issue, I’ve improved my code-reading skills. I still can’t write everything from scratch, but I can modify existing code to build features within the current implementation scope.
* I believe I’ll complete it by the end of the month and am hoping to make it public on Codeberg!
* One last thing - I was added as a member of the Forgejo organization on Codeberg. I’m proud that, after the Fedora Project, my contributions were acknowledged in Forgejo as well. I look forward to making even more meaningful contributions!
* [feat(ui): commit view redesign for pull request page #7948](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/7948)

### 3. Good First Issue in Forgejo
![milestone-bug](https://iamyaash.github.io/blog/posts/m6/milestone-bug.png)
* _bug: nil pointer evaluating *issues.Milestone.Name when clearing milestone_ [#7949](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/7949)
    *  _fix(ui): resolved 500 error upon clicking 'Clear milestone' button when there's no milestones available in Issue page_ [#8266](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/8266) ⏳ (under review; _fixed the bug, but I still have to write test cases for that!_)
    * This is relatively an easy issue, but it made me read so many lines of code and their logic, but I was able to find a solution by, disabling the "Clear milestone" button when there's nothing selected or no milestones are available. Which seems to fix the bug and it's working fine now!

*  bug: bad placing when action disabled [#4580](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/4580).
    * An element seem to overlapping when the file name gets longer. I think we can fix it by making it responsive by wrapping the text of file name when it's too long.
