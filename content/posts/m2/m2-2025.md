# Monthly Report - `m2`:
1. Got my onboarding ticket closed at [WelcomeToFedora/issue/2](https://pagure.io/fedora-join/WelcomeToFedora/issue/2) and I'm finally one of the Fedora people.
2. Progression on Forgejo
    - Sent mail to **logo@fedoraproject.org** requesting Fedora Logo & received it couple of days after. Changed the Logo & Favicon successfuly in Forgejo build of Fedora.
    - Changed the color of theme by tweaking the css elements of theme files in `web_src/css/themes/*`.
    - Changed the UI element by modifying the element in `modules/settings/ui.go`.
3. Registered for DevConf India conference.
    - This is going to be my first time attending a conference, first time travelling in flight, first time travelling alone and staying alone.
    - Conducted on _28th February to 1st March_, as I will be staying there for 2 days in Pune. Excited!
4. Being more active in the community than before, got connected with lot of folks there, especially #join-fedora.
5. Got a **Raspberry Pi 5**, this is also my first time using one.
    - Expermenting with it for a while now.
    - Amazing to see that it can run on mobile powerbank battery. It's crazy!
    - I'm getting lot of crazy ideas, like portable self hosted services within my palm. Even when I don't have internet connection, I can still use a PC in a mobile. Well, let's see...
