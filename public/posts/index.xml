      <description>Monthly Report - m4: Added border color on vertical navbar in Forgejo light theme, which went unnoticed while making changes previously and got the PR Merged ✅. (It&amp;rsquo;s relatively a simple fix tho)
Started looking into the upstream forgejo/forgejo issues and found these two issue to be interesting,
feat: indicate commit order in PR view #5178 feat: appearance setting should have an font size setting (accessibility) #5693 I have talked with the folks in Forgejo Matrix channel about #5693 issue, as it seems more interesting and is a low-hanging fruit.</description>

      <description>Monthly Report -m1: Started using jrnl cmd tool for taking notes &amp;amp; using it sort of like a journal. Merged PR 2418. Migrating essential Information from infra/hosts to infra/ansible. Manually copied the notes variable from each hosts on infra/hosts. In which the name of the hostname shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be phx2 and the same hostname should present in infra/ansible as well. I was supposed to do it using a script, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have that much experience using scripts on remote servers.</description>
