      <description>Monthly Report -m1: Started using jrnl cmd tool for taking notes &amp;amp; using it sort of like a journal. Merged PR 2418. Migrating essential Information from infra/hosts to infra/ansible. Manually copied the notes variable from each hosts on infra/hosts. In which the name of the hostname shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be phx2 and the same hostname should present in infra/ansible as well. I was supposed to do it using a script, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have that much experience using scripts on remote servers.</description>
